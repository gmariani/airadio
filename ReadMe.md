## Description
AIRadio is an AIR based web radio player. It loads the play.it radio player powered by CBS Radio. After moving away from Florida I missed my favorite radio station, O'Rock 105.9. I later found that they played their music online via this Flash based player. So I built this application to host it out of the browser and minimize to the tray for easy listening.

**Note** It looks like the play.it player has been deprecated and no longer available. Feel free to access this for archival purposes.

## Features
- Minimize to tray
- Self contained application
- Auto-update capability
